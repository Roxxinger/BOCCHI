///     This is stuck <i>recovery</i>, not jump-aware routing: it tells the router nothing and needs

///     </para>
///     Self-contained on purpose — it watches position itself rather than hanging off a movement
///     hook, because the treasure and carrot hunts drive vnav directly and would miss one.
