Cloudflare Worker that accepts anonymous treasure-coffer and chewed-carrot observations from BOCCHI, plus pot-cycle sync.

Payload shape for coffers matches AOCC (`POST /api/v1/observations`) so the plugin URL can point at either API.

Unlike AOCC’s pot-reveal-only filter, this API accepts **any positive coffer `dataId`** in Occult Crescent territories (**1252** South Horn, **1346** North Horn).

**End-user use in BOCCHI (Config → Treasure Hunter → Share maps with the community; default on):**
- **Pot cycles** (`/api/v1/pot-cycles`) — share Magic Pot spawn anchors per instance.
- **Carrot locations** (`/api/v1/carrot-locations`) — Carrot Hunt downloads accepted pads and merges with baked list; clients upload sightings.
- **Coffer candidates** (`/api/v1/candidates` + observation POST) — Treasure Hunt downloads accepted spots and unions them with the baked map; clients upload bronze/silver opens.

## Paid-plan behaviour

- Cron every **5 minutes** (processors + pot-cycle prune).
- Coffer/carrot clustering processes up to **500** pending rows per run.
- Pot-cycle prune deletes up to **25k × 20 rounds** per cron (no free-tier write cap).
- Unique index on `(instance_key, pot_fate_id, spawn_at_unix)` + `INSERT OR IGNORE`.
- Public catalogs (`/api/v1/candidates`, `/api/v1/carrot-locations`) use edge Cache API + `Cache-Control: max-age=300`.
- Separate IP rate limits: **60/min** observations & carrots, **120/min** pot-cycle GET/POST.

## Local setup

```powershell
cd cloudflare/coffer-api
npm install
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run dev
```

- `GET http://localhost:8787/health`
- `POST http://localhost:8787/api/v1/observations`
- `GET http://localhost:8787/api/v1/candidates?territoryId=1252` (accepted catalog for hunt routing)
- `POST http://localhost:8787/api/v1/carrot-locations`
- `GET http://localhost:8787/api/v1/carrot-locations?territoryId=1252` (accepted carrot pads)
- `POST http://localhost:8787/api/v1/pot-cycles`
- `GET http://localhost:8787/api/v1/pot-cycles?instanceKey=...`

## Deploy

```powershell
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler d1 create bocchi-coffer-observations
# Paste the returned database_id into wrangler.jsonc → d1_databases[0].database_id
npm run db:migrate:remote
npm run deploy
```

Copy into BOCCHI is not required — the plugin posts to:

`https://bocchi-coffer-api.kagekazu.workers.dev/api/v1/observations`

(URL is hardcoded; sync follows Share maps — default on, while in Occult Crescent.)

Optional admin token:

```powershell
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN
```

## Privacy

Submissions are anonymous (no character or account names). Stored coffer fields are territory, coffer data id, world coordinates, coffer type label, installation hash, plugin version, and observed time.

Pot-cycle rows store an instance fingerprint hash, territory, datacenter id, pot fate id, spawn unix time, installation hash, plugin version, and observed time.

Carrot location rows store territory, world coordinates, object base id (`2010139`), installation hash, plugin version, and observed time. Candidates auto-accept after three distinct installations within ~1.5 yalms.
